# The Slowest Lab

This app stores venues, shows, users, attendances of users to shows, and follows between users.  It's so slow!  Make it fast.  Write in the readme of your repo what changes you made and what effect they had.

To get started:

```
rake db:create
rails dbconsole
```

Then in `rails dbconsole` do: `\i dump.sql`
